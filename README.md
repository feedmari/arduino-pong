# arduino-pong
Project for the Embedded System course of the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and Engineering of Cesena [UNIBO]. The objective of this project is to create an hand-free version of the pong using the Arduino platform, sensors and actuators.

## Getting Started

The objective of this project is to realize an Arduino system able to simulate the Pong game between two  players. It is provided with the normal functionalities (e.g play with the pads) but it will be also possible to play in an hand-free way, using sensors and actuators like proximity sensors, pads and so on. 
In the report is possible to find in details the analysis and the design of the project.

### Prerequisites

- 2x Arduino Uno <br>
- 1x Led Matrix 16x32 RGB (https://www.adafruit.com/product/420) <br>
- 2x Joysticks ((https://www.adafruit.com/product/512) <br>
- 4x Proximity sensors

Two Arduino Uno are needed since one will be the controller of the game and the other will contain the logic of the entire game. They will communicate using a communication system described in detail into the report.
